            <br /> I'm a passionate and detail-oriented developer with a strong
            interest in building scalable, user-friendly applications. With
            hands-on experience in technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js,
            and Tailwind CSS, I enjoy creating clean, efficient solutions that
            solve real-world problems. I'm committed to continuous learning and
            growth â€” whether through building side projects, contributing to
            open-source, or exploring new frameworks and tools. I believe in
            writing clean, maintainable code and value collaboration,
            performance, and great user experience in every project I take on.
            My goal is to grow as a well-rounded software engineer who
            contributes meaningfully to both the codebase and the team culture.
